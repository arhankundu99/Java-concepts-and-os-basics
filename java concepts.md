# Pass by value and pass by reference
In pass by value, we pass the copy of the parameters to a function. so any changes made to the copy will not be reflected to the actual parameters.
In pass by reference, we pass the address of the parameter to the function, so if we make changes using the address, then the changes will also be reflected in the actual parameters

In java, we can only pass by value, we cannot pass by reference.
